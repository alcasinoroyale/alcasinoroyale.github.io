Throughout the past month or so, my progress at the FlatIron has decreased drastically. When I first started at the FlatIron in June, I established a couple of goals for the progress I wanted to make. I was hoping to be finished sometime in November or December. However, when I reached the Object Orientation in Ruby, I became a bit overwhelmed with the threshold of material I had to learn and all of the concepts involved. 

Despite taking notes on all of the various concepts, sometimes I would find myself spending hours working on a lab trying to solve everything on my own. This combined with work as well as some personal struggles almost make me take a break from FlatIron. I still came online to complete a few labs here and there, but I didn't have the same motivation or determination. So I had to reflect back on what I really loved about coding: the architectural, creative, and technical aspects. 

Going forward, I would like to noy only be more organized and thoughtful with my goals, but also find a balance between work and school so that I will relieve my stress level. There are numerous concepts that I've struggled with, but I'm ready to face these challenges. It's always important to ask for help as well, something I've barely done during my programming journey. During the next few days, I want to focus mainly on reviewing the object orientation in Ruby material so that I can begin working on my first portfolio project.
