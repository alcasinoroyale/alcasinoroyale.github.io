When I started reading "The Complete Software Developer’s Career Guide" by John Sonmez, I was overwhelmed by its length of 796 pages. However, Sonmez's writing style eliminates any fear of this. It's not only an incredibly conversational and comedic read but also one of the most resourceful books that I've encountered.

Throughout the job search, I've been searching for any resources that could improve your programming and communication outside of what I've already learned. Sonmez discusses a lot of valuable lessons to face these challenges such as developing confidence, building new projects, and promoting yourself in a competitive market. In this blog post, I’m going to cover some of those from the first section that I’ve read so far.

Sonmez emphasizes that software developers should become immersed in the ideas and concepts they want to integrate into their lives. This ranges from learning a new programming language to networking with other programmers to expanding your resume. When building new projects and applications, it’s not just about what you code, but learning how to communicate it to others, especially in interviews and conversations with other engineers. 

I found it interesting when Sonmez pointed out that a senior developer who came in for an interview, struggled despite having the years of experience on their resume. I think the reason for this could be that since programming is constantly evolving, some people forget that languages and frameworks are actively updated and there are different trends that the tech industry experiences.

One of the strategies that developers can utilize frequently to conquer this is exploring and comprehending the code of existing applications and open source projects. Learning algorithms and data structures is important, but you also need to understand that applications go beyond one programming language. When you analyze the code of real-world applications, 

Sonmez explains that you should study the stack, the features and libraries, and how they all converge together. This is incredibly crucial when developing your own projects because they require work across multiple languages. Practicing consistently, whether that's debugging or redesigning, will help you discover more of your strengths. If you’re developing the front-end and back-end, understanding how both sides collaborate to develop the finished product is more beneficial than just knowing concepts.

While Sonmez discusses what can help software developers from a technical perspective, he also describes how becoming actively involved in the software development community will lead to more career opportunities. All software developers, regardless of whether they attended college, a boot camp, or were self-taught, have faced similar challenges and experiences during their programming journey. 

In the workplace, you’ll likely be working with a team or with a variety of departments to design and build applications. If you network with others in the industry consistently, you will get a much better sense of how to interact and collaborate with co-workers and understand their perspectives. Employers don't hire machines, they want people they can trust and get along with.
